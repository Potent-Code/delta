This is a library of a few useful mathematical routines.
It is currently under active development and so can be 
expected to grow. Good data types and allocations are 
included for matrices, vectors, and vector functions. 
It can also solve linear systems by LU factorization, 
find the root of a polynomial and solve simple ODEs.
